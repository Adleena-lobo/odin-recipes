            <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
                <p>Momo are bite-size dumplings made with a spoonful of stuffing wrapped in dough. Momo are usually steamed, though they are sometimes fried or steam-fried. Meat or vegetables fillings becomes succulent as it produces an intensively flavored broth sealed inside the wrappers. Momo is an important dish for Tibetans, both for everyday and festivals</p>
                <p>Momo is the colloquial form of the Tibetan word "mog mog".[2] It is possible that this Tibetan word is borrowed from the Chinese term momo (馍馍), a name traditionally used in northwestern Chinese dialects for bread.[3] The word mo (馍) itself means food related to flour.</p>
